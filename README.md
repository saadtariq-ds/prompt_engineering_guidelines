# Prompt Engineering Guidelines

Prompt engineering is an AI engineering technique used to refine large language models (LLMs) with specific prompts and recommended outputs. It is also the process of refining input to various generative AI services to generate text or images. As generative AI tools continue to improve, prompt engineering will become increasingly important in generating other types of content, such as robotic process automation bots, 3D assets, scripts, robot instructions, and other digital artifacts.
